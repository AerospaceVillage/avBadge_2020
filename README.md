# Aerospace Village Badge 2020

This resository is to document and capture all of the engineering and design work that went into creating the [Aerospace Village](https://aerospacevillage.org) Badge for 2020.

The badge is a multifunctional design that is part SWAG, part antenna, part low level protocol interaction. In keeping with the spirit of aviation everything is as small as possible and tries to use as much of the available resources as possible.

You can even use this airplane shaped badge as an anetenna to locate real airplanes transmitting ADS-B. Additionally, you can also use it to capture data from other freqenices (i.e. ACARS) using the built in SMA to wire terminal blocks. Why stop there? You can also interact with your preferred I2C device ([bus pirate](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bus-pirate-v36a-hookup-guide/all#introduction)) and control each of the available lighting packages. Alternatively, you could just wear it and look cool.
